## What are Blueprints?

Review the [Blueprints Crash Course](./docs/index.md) to get started. Here's a quick overview:

Blueprints are WordPress setup descriptions that can be previewed live in [WordPress Playground](https://w.org/playground). Just like this one:

```json
{
    "plugins": ["hello-dolly", "gutenberg"],
    "login": true,
    "landingPage": "/wp-admin/plugins.php"
}
```

[<kbd> <br> Preview in WordPress Playground <br> </kbd>](https://playground.wordpress.net/#%7B%22plugins%22:%5B%22hello-dolly%22,%22gutenberg%22%5D,%20%22login%22:%20true,%20%22landingPage%22:%20%22/wp-admin/plugins.php%22%20%7D)

Blueprints contain all the setup information including plugins, themes, site options, starter content to import, and more.
