## What are Blueprints and how are they useful?

Blueprints are JSON files you can use to create a whole website, including plugins, themes, content (posts, pages, taxonomy, and comments), settings (site name, users, permalinks, and more), etc. You can generate a WooCommerce store complete with products, a magazine populated with articles, a corporate blog with multiple users, and more.

Blueprints support advanced use cases, like file system and database manipulation, and gives you fine-grained control over the instance you create. The WordPress Test Team has been using Playground in [the 6.5 beta release cycle](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/03/wordpress-6-5-release-candidate-2/), creating a Blueprint that loads the latest version, several testing plugins, and dummy data.

### A simple Blueprint example

A Blueprint might look something like this:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["akismet", "gutenberg"],
  "themes": ["twentynineteen"],
  "settings": {
    "blogname": "My Blog",
    "blogdescription": "Just another WordPress site"
  },
  "constants": {
    "WP_DEBUG": true
  }
}
```

In this example, the Blueprint installs the Akismet and Gutenberg plugins, the Twenty Nineteen theme, and sets the site name and description. It also enables debugging mode.

### Blueprints Strengths

Blueprints are an invaluable tool for building WordPress sites:

* **Flexibility** – With Blueprints, developers can make surgical adjustments to the build process.
* **Consistency**: Blueprints ensure that every new site starts with the same configuration.
* **Lightweight** – Blueprints are tiny text files that cost almost nothing to store or transfer.
* **Transparency** – A Blueprint includes all the commands needed to build a WordPress Snapshot. You can read through it and understand exactly how the site is built.
* **Time Efficiency**: By using Blueprints, the time-consuming process of manually setting up a new WordPress site is significantly reduced. Instead of going through the steps of installing and configuring themes and plugins for each new project, a Blueprint can be applied to set everything up.
* **Up-to-date dependencies** – A typical Blueprint fetches the latest version of WordPress, a particular plugin, and, perhaps, a theme. The resulting Snapshot is then up to date with the latest features and security fixes.
4. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Blueprints easy to diff and review in tools like GitHub and can be shared within a team or with the WordPress community, allowing others to benefit from a well-configured setup. 
* **Experimentation and Learning**: For those new to WordPress or looking to experiment with different configurations, Blueprints provide a safe and easy way to try out various setups without the risk of breaking a live site.
* **WordPress.org integration** – Writing a Blueprint enables you to demo your plugin in the WordPress plugin directory.
* **Spinning a development environment** – A new developer in the team could just download the Blueprint, run a hypothetical wp up command, and get a fresh dev env. The CI scripts could reuse the same method, and even the production build could be based on a Blueprint.

### Blueprints Use Cases

* Developers can add a Preview button to their [plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/previews-and-blueprints/) submissions or [Theme Trac tickets](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7382)
* Check out [the Blueprints examples](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/blueprints-api/examples) and [the various demos and apps](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/links-and-resources#apps-built-with-wordpress-playground) in the docs to learn more about the (endless) possibilities of Blueprints.
* Embed a pre-configured WordPress site in your website using the [WordPress Playground Block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/interactive-code-block/).
