### Blueprints version 2

The team is exploring ways to transition Blueprints from a TypeScript library to a PHP library to enable running them in all WordPress environments – whether they're Playground, a hosted site, or your local setup.

The proposed [new specification](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/issues/6) is discussed on a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/), and you’re more than welcome to join (there or on the [#meta-playground](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04EWKGDJ0K) Slack channel) and help shape the next generation of Playground.
