### Developer Tools

If you use an IDE like VSCode or PHPStorm, use the Blueprint JSON Schema for an autocompleted Blueprint development experience. Simply add the following line at the top of your blueprint.json file:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://playground.wordpress.net/blueprint-schema.json"
}
```
