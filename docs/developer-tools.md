## Developer Tools

### JSON Schema

If you use an IDE like VSCode or PHPStorm, use the Blueprint JSON Schema for an autocompleted Blueprint development experience. Simply add the following line at the top of your blueprint.json file:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://playground.wordpress.net/blueprint-schema.json"
}
```

### Blueprints Builder

You use this in-browser Blueprints editor to build, validate, and preview your Blueprints in the browser. Note the editor is under development and the embedded Playground sometimes won't load â€“ in these cases you'll need to refresh the page. We are aware of these shortcomings and are working to improve the experience.
